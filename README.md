      Enumerated types
      Member initializer syntax in constructor definition
      Dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation
      Single Inheritance (public inheritance only): at least 3 levels
      Abstract classes (pure virtual functions)
      Polymorphism (virtual functions & virtual destructor)
      Operator overloading
      Exception handling
      Function template or class template
      STL
      Text file I/O
